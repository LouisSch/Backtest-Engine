## âœ¨ Features
- **GBM + Jump Tick Simulation**
  Simulates realistic tick-level price movements using Geometric Brownian Motion with jumps.
- **Pluggable Strategy Interface**
  Easily add or modify trading strategies (Mean Reversion, Breakout, Spread, etc...)
- **Multi-Strategy Execution**
  Backtest several strategies in parallel on the same tick stream.
- **Dockerized**
  Fully containerized, just build and run with Docker in a few seconds.
- **Performance Monitoring**
  Execution time logging to benchmark strategies and engine throughput.

## ðŸ“ˆ Strategues Included
- `MeanReversionSimple`
- `BreakoutStrategy`
- `SpreadStrategy`

Each strategy runs on the same tick series with configurable parameters and initial capital.
